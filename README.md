# dmr_loadings
Use Water (formerly DMR) Loading Tool REST services to generate data files. The Loading Tool generates loadings for all pollutants in DMRs and allows for estimation of unreported values. It uses consistent metholodogies to convert concentrations into quantities when only the former are available. It also offers aggregations of similar pollutants (e.g., combining different types of Nitrogen into one measure).
